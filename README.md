This is my solutions, mainly in Excel

Even though most days would be compatible with OnlyOffice, Microsoft Excel is used. Biggest difference is currently performance

Notes
-----

I'm a software developer, mainly focusing on embedded C, python and other languages. I do this in excel because of the challenge, and to force myself to think outside the box, for the optimization required to fit into a spreadsheet.

### 2023

This year I didn't really have time to focus on AoC. Got at least one done in
Excel though.

But discussed it and helped a friend with some algorithms, so some days I solved
in other more normal languages. Those are added in `non_excel` directory too,
and marked with `.` where I sovled them.

Solved
------

Note: Days marked with "." is missing solutions, and possible not via Excel, and is therefore not available in this repo. Only marked as solved for me at the AoC page.
